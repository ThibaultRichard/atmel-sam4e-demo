# atmel-sam4e-demo
I developed this cool demo while working at Atmel. It was initially designed for SAM4E EK eval board, featuring QTouch, Sound processing using ADC/DAC, DSP, LCD display and also runs lwIP based HTTP server! It all runs in a multi threaded environment using FreeRTOS.
Folder structure is not my fav, but following Atmel example structure. Init and tasks are implemented under sam/applications folder! Enjoy ;-)
